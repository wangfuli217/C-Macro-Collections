<h1 id='linkedlist-h'>linkedlist.h</h1>
<p>A LinkedList is a linear collection of elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next (singly-linked list) and to a previous one (doubly-linked list). It consists of nodes connected by these next or previous pointers. Unlike an array, the LinkedList can indefinitely grow.</p>
<h2 id='linkedlist-implementation'>LinkedList Implementation</h2>
<p>The LinkedList is implemented as a doubly-linked list and allows insertions and removals at both ends in O(1) and in a given index in O(N). The list has a head and tail pointer. The head points to the first element in the sequence and tail points to the last.</p>
