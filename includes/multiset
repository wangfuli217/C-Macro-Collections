<p>In mathematics, a multiset is a modification of the concept of a set that, unlike a set, allows for multiple instances for each of its elements. The positive integer number of instances, given for each element is called the multiplicity of this element in the multiset. A MultiSet also has a cardinality which equals the sum of the multiplicities of its elements.</p>
